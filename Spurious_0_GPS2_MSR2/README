Spurious signal Analysis:
In CAM the timestamp is 2021-04-07 20:21:33 which is not on a 15min boundary and i don't see it when I plot it locally. Therefore, I'm not going to continue looking for the reason.

Whilst doing this I did notice a bigger spur in the prefit data which I traced to the following data points in /var/lib/tfr_sync/raw.log.7
Apr 06 18:42:00 tmc sync: 1617734520.000 cggtts.gps2-msr2-pull 2 0.000
Apr 06 18:58:00 tmc sync: 1617735480.000 cggtts.gps2-msr2-pull 2 0.000
Apr 06 19:14:00 tmc sync: 1617736440.000 cggtts.gps2-msr2-pull 2 0.000

There isn't more historic raw data but from vtss_input.log* files I located 1 more for gps2-msr2:
Mar 31 08:30:00 tmc sync: 1617179400.000 cggtts.gps2-msr2-pull.15min 2 0.000

I talked to Grant about these and in future releases these will be marked as error status. The filters smoothed the outliers out in anycase.

There was one more outlier for msr1-msr2 which was marked as unreachable and i was happy to see vtss not including the data point.
